## Problem Statement
Managing multiple knowledge bases with different types of documents (text, PDFs, images, Word docs) is challenging without proper organization and search capabilities. Additionally, integrating these knowledge bases with AI tools requires complex setup. Users need a way to:
- Store documents in organized, vector-indexed knowledge bases
- Search across document contents semantically
- Manage files through a web interface
- Access information quickly without manual file browsing
- Integrate knowledge bases with AI tools like Cline via MCP servers

## Solution Approach
A vector storage and MCP management platform that automatically processes documents into vector embeddings, enables semantic search, and creates MCP servers for seamless integration with AI tools.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Simple web UI for all operations
2. **Fast Search**: Quick semantic search with relevant results
3. **Easy File Management**: Drag-and-drop file uploads, easy deletion
4. **Organized Storage**: Clear separation between different knowledge bases
5. **Reliable Processing**: Robust text extraction from various file formats
6. **Seamless Integration**: Automatic MCP server creation for AI tool access
7. **Customizable Tools**: Edit MCP tool descriptions to match specific use cases

## Key User Workflows
1. **Create Knowledge Base**: Set up new knowledge base with vector storage
2. **Upload Files**: Add documents with automatic vector indexing
3. **Search Content**: Query across all files using semantic search
4. **Manage Files**: View, update, or remove existing files
5. **Reindex**: Refresh vector index when needed
6. **MCP Integration**: Create and manage MCP servers for external tool access
7. **Customize Tools**: Edit tool and parameter descriptions for MCP servers

## Success Metrics
- All supported file types process correctly with vector embeddings
- Search returns relevant results within 2 seconds
- File uploads complete successfully with progress feedback
- Interface works smoothly for managing multiple knowledge bases
- MCP servers integrate seamlessly with AI tools like Cline
- Tool descriptions can be customized and persist across sessions

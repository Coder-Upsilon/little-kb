# Product Context: VectorVault

## Problem Statement
Managing multiple knowledge bases with different types of documents (text, PDFs, images, Word docs) is challenging without proper organization and search capabilities. Users need a way to:
- Store documents in organized knowledge bases
- Search across document contents semantically
- Manage files through a web interface
- Access information quickly without manual file browsing

## Solution Approach
A web-based knowledge management system that automatically processes and indexes documents into vector storage, enabling semantic search across all content.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Simple web UI for all operations
2. **Fast Search**: Quick semantic search with relevant results
3. **Easy File Management**: Drag-and-drop file uploads, easy deletion
4. **Organized Storage**: Clear separation between different knowledge bases
5. **Reliable Processing**: Robust text extraction from various file formats

## Key User Workflows
1. **Create Knowledge Base**: Set up new knowledge base with a name
2. **Upload Files**: Add documents to specific knowledge base
3. **Search Content**: Query across all files in a knowledge base
4. **Manage Files**: View, update, or remove existing files
5. **Reindex**: Refresh vector index when needed

## Success Metrics
- All supported file types process correctly
- Search returns relevant results within 2 seconds
- File uploads complete successfully with progress feedback
- Interface works smoothly for managing multiple knowledge bases

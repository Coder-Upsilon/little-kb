# Active Context: Little KB Development - COMPLETED

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION
The knowledge base management webapp has been successfully completed and is fully operational with both backend and frontend running.

## Application Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI + ChromaDB)
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000 (React + TypeScript + Material-UI)
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Database**: ChromaDB with vector embeddings working correctly

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Complete full-stack application built and tested
- ✅ Knowledge base creation, management, and deletion working
- ✅ File upload system with drag-and-drop interface implemented
- ✅ Document processing pipeline with chunking and embedding
- ✅ Semantic search functionality with similarity scoring
- ✅ Professional UI with Material-UI components
- ✅ Real-time statistics and status updates
- ✅ Navigation between list, detail, and search views
- ✅ **MCP Tool Description Editing** - Users can now customize both tool-level and parameter descriptions for MCP servers
- ✅ **External URL Access Testing** - Verified curl can successfully access external documentation (e.g., Apple Developer docs) - potential for future web scraping/ingestion features

## Live Testing Results (from terminal logs)
Based on API call logs, the user has successfully tested:
- ✅ Knowledge base creation and listing
- ✅ File upload functionality (including image files)
- ✅ Document processing and indexing
- ✅ Reindexing operations
- ✅ Search operations with query processing
- ✅ Statistics retrieval and display
- ✅ API documentation access

## Latest Feature: MCP Tool Description Editing (December 2025)

### What Was Implemented
Users can now fully customize MCP tool descriptions including:
- **Tool-level descriptions**: Edit descriptions for search_knowledge_base, get_knowledge_base_info, and list_documents tools
- **Parameter descriptions**: Edit descriptions for query and limit parameters within the search_knowledge_base tool
- **UI Integration**: Edit/Save/Cancel pattern in both MCPServerManager and KnowledgeBaseDetail components
- **Auto-restart**: Running MCP servers automatically restart when descriptions are updated

### Technical Details
1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Modified `KnowledgeBaseMCPServer.setup_handlers()` to read custom parameter descriptions from `tool_descriptions.search_knowledge_base_params`
   - Added `update_tool_descriptions()` method to MCPServerManager with auto-restart capability
   - Updated `/mcp/{server_id}/config` API endpoint to return both tool and parameter descriptions
   - New API endpoint: `PUT /mcp/{server_id}/tool-descriptions`

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Added `parameterDescriptions` state management in both UI components
   - Updated Tool Descriptions accordion to show 2 sections: Tool Descriptions + Parameter Descriptions
   - Read-only view displays all tool and parameter descriptions
   - Edit mode provides text fields for customizing all descriptions
   - Combined save operation updates both tool and parameter descriptions atomically

3. **Storage**:
   - Tool descriptions stored in `mcp_config.json` under `tool_descriptions` key
   - Parameter descriptions nested under `tool_descriptions.search_knowledge_base_params`
   - Falls back to default descriptions if not customized

### Files Modified
- `backend/app/services/mcp_service.py`
- `backend/app/routers/mcp.py`
- `frontend/src/components/MCPServerManager.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/KnowledgeBaseDetail.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Completed
- **Backend Services**: Knowledge base service, file processor, vector service, MCP service
- **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API with CRUD operations, MCP configuration endpoints
- **Frontend Components**: App, KnowledgeBaseDetail, SearchInterface, FileUpload, MCPServerManager
- **Database Integration**: ChromaDB with sentence transformers
- **File Processing**: PDF, DOCX, text files, and image OCR support
- **MCP Integration**: Full MCP server management with customizable tool and parameter descriptions

## Known Issues Identified
- OCR functionality requires tesseract installation for image processing
- Some image uploads may fail without tesseract (422 error observed)
- Minor ESLint warnings for unused imports (non-critical)

## Current Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + ChromaDB + sentence-transformers + uv
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Material-UI + Axios
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized structure
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search with similarity scoring
- **UI/UX**: Professional Material-UI design with responsive layout

## User Workflow Verified
1. ✅ Create knowledge bases through web interface
2. ✅ Upload documents via drag-and-drop or file picker
3. ✅ Automatic processing, chunking, and embedding
4. ✅ View document statistics and management
5. ✅ Perform semantic searches with highlighted results
6. ✅ Navigate between different views seamlessly

## Recent Exploration (January 2026)
- Tested external URL access via curl to Apple Developer documentation
- Successfully retrieved JSON documentation for AVRouting framework
- Verified curl functionality for potential future features:
  - Web scraping capabilities
  - URL-based document ingestion
  - External API data integration

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Install tesseract for full OCR support
- Clean up unused imports for cleaner code
- Add more file format support if needed
- Consider deployment configuration for production
- Explore URL-based content ingestion for knowledge bases
- Web scraping functionality for documentation sites

## Project Status: COMPLETE ✅
The application meets all original requirements and is fully functional for knowledge base management with semantic search capabilities.

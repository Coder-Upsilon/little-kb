## NEW PROJECT: Electron Desktop App Conversion (January 2026)

### Objective
Convert the existing web application (FastAPI backend + React frontend) into a self-contained Electron desktop application that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Conversion Strategy

#### Architecture Approach
```
Electron Main Process (Little KB)
├── Backend Subprocess (Python FastAPI packaged with PyInstaller)
├── Frontend Window (React app as renderer process)
└── IPC Communication Layer
```

#### Key Requirements
- **App Name**: "Little KB" (display name) / "little-kb" (technical name)
- **Bundle ID**: com.littlekb.app
- **Cross-Platform**: macOS, Windows, Linux builds
- **Self-Contained**: No external Python/Node.js installation required
- **Data Storage**: Platform-appropriate app data directories

### Implementation Progress

#### Phase 1: Preparation & Setup
- [ ] **Step 1**: Update memory bank documentation (Current Step)
- [ ] **Step 2**: Audit and correct all naming inconsistencies to "little-kb"
  - Files to check: package.json, pyproject.toml, README files, documentation
  - Ensure consistent branding throughout

#### Phase 2: Electron Framework Setup
- [ ] **Step 3**: Initialize Electron project structure
  - Install Electron and electron-builder dependencies
  - Create electron/ directory with main process files
  - Set up TypeScript configuration for Electron
  
- [ ] **Step 4**: Create main process with window management
  - Implement app lifecycle (startup, shutdown)
  - Create main window with proper dimensions
  - Set up IPC communication handlers
  - Add system tray integration

#### Phase 3: Backend Integration
- [ ] **Step 5**: Configure Python backend as subprocess
  - Create PyInstaller spec file for backend packaging
  - Implement backend process spawning in Electron main
  - Add health check and auto-restart logic
  - Handle port management (dynamic port allocation)
  - Implement graceful shutdown

#### Phase 4: Frontend Adaptation
- [ ] **Step 6**: Adapt React frontend for Electron
  - Update API endpoint configuration (dynamic backend URL)
  - Add Electron-specific features (file dialogs, notifications)
  - Configure build process for Electron renderer
  - Update CSP and security policies

#### Phase 5: Build & Distribution
- [ ] **Step 7**: Implement cross-platform build configuration
  - Configure electron-builder for macOS (.dmg, .app)
  - Configure electron-builder for Windows (.exe, .msi)
  - Configure electron-builder for Linux (.deb, .rpm, .AppImage)
  - Set up app icons and resources for each platform

- [ ] **Step 8**: Set up data storage and app directories
  - Configure platform-specific paths:
    - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Little KB/
    - Windows: %APPDATA%/Little KB/
    - Linux: ~/.config/little-kb/
  - Migrate knowledge-bases and vector-db to app data directory
  - Ensure proper file permissions

- [ ] **Step 9**: Configure code signing and distribution
  - Set up macOS code signing (requires Apple Developer account)
  - Set up Windows code signing (optional, requires certificate)
  - Create installer configurations
  - Test installation and uninstallation flows

#### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Step 10**: Test builds on all target platforms
  - Test on macOS (native build)
  - Test on Windows (via Wine or VM)
  - Test on Linux (native build)
  - Verify all features work in packaged app
  - Test auto-update mechanism

### Technical Decisions

#### Backend Packaging Strategy
- **Tool**: PyInstaller (creates standalone Python executable)
- **Advantages**: 
  - No Python installation required on user machine
  - Bundles all dependencies including ChromaDB
  - Works across all target platforms
- **Challenges**:
  - Large bundle size due to ML models (sentence-transformers)
  - Need to handle dynamic imports and data files

#### Electron Build Configuration
- **Builder**: electron-builder
- **Advantages**:
  - Handles all three platforms from single configuration
  - Built-in auto-update support
  - Code signing integration
  - Multiple installer formats

#### Data Storage Architecture
```
App Data Directory/
├── knowledge-bases/        # Migrated from project root
├── vector-db/             # ChromaDB persistence
├── logs/                  # Application logs
└── config.json           # User preferences
```

### Known Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Python Backend Size
- **Issue**: sentence-transformers models are large (~400MB)
- **Solution**: Bundle with app, optimize with model compression if needed
- **Alternative**: Download models on first run (requires internet)

#### Challenge 2: Port Management
- **Issue**: Backend needs available port, may conflict
- **Solution**: Dynamic port detection, store in config, pass to frontend

#### Challenge 3: Backend Startup Time
- **Issue**: Python + FastAPI + ML models take time to initialize
- **Solution**: Show splash screen during startup, implement health checks

#### Challenge 4: Cross-Platform Testing
- **Issue**: Need to test on macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Solution**: Build on macOS (can build for all), test Windows via VM

### Current Status
**Phase**: Planning Complete, Starting Implementation
**Next Step**: Update memory bank (this file), then audit project naming

### Notes
- Original project name "VectorVault" being renamed to "Little KB" throughout
- Maintaining all existing functionality in desktop app
- Adding desktop-specific features (system integration, notifications)
- Will preserve local web server architecture (easier to maintain)

2. **Document Management**
   - Upload multiple files via drag-and-drop or file picker
   - Support for PDF, DOCX, text, and image files
   - Automatic processing and chunking
   - View document metadata and statistics
   - Delete individual documents

3. **Semantic Search**
   - Natural language query processing
   - Vector similarity search with scoring
   - Highlighted search results
   - Configurable result limits
   - Search statistics and status

4. **MCP Server Integration** ✅ NEW
   - Create and manage MCP servers for knowledge bases
   - Support for single-KB and multi-KB servers
   - Start/stop server controls with status monitoring
   - Configuration generation for Cline and Claude Desktop
   - **Editable tool descriptions**: Customize descriptions for all 3 MCP tools
   - **Editable parameter descriptions**: Customize query and limit parameter descriptions
   - Auto-restart servers when descriptions are updated
   - Copy-to-clipboard for easy configuration
   - Two-tab interface (Cline vs Claude Desktop formats)
   - Server instructions editing with auto-restart
   - Default server assignment per knowledge base

5. **User Interface**
   - Professional Material-UI design

   - Intuitive navigation between views
   - Real-time updates and feedback

## Performance Metrics
- **Backend Response Times**: Sub-second API responses
- **Frontend Load Times**: Fast React component rendering
- **Search Performance**: Efficient vector similarity search
- **File Processing**: Automatic background processing
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized ChromaDB operations

## Known Limitations
- **OCR Dependency**: Tesseract required for image text extraction
- **File Size Limits**: Currently set to 50MB per file
- **Single User**: No authentication system (as per requirements)
- **Local Storage**: Files stored locally (suitable for single-user setup)

## Deployment Ready
The application is ready for use with:
- Backend running on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
- API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs
- All core functionality tested and working

## Latest Enhancement: MCP Tool Description Editing (December 2025)

### Feature Overview
Added comprehensive editing capabilities for MCP tool and parameter descriptions:
- **Tool-Level Descriptions**: Edit descriptions for search_knowledge_base, get_knowledge_base_info, and list_documents
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Edit descriptions for query and limit parameters within search_knowledge_base
- **Dual Interface**: Available in both MCPServerManager and KnowledgeBaseDetail components
- **Persistent Storage**: Descriptions saved in mcp_config.json with fallback to defaults
- **Auto-Restart**: Running servers automatically restart when descriptions are updated

### Implementation Details
- **Backend**: Modified MCP service to read custom parameter descriptions, added update endpoint
- **Frontend**: Added state management, edit/save/cancel UI pattern, dual-section display
- **API**: New `PUT /mcp/{server_id}/tool-descriptions` endpoint for updates
- **Storage Format**: Nested structure with `tool_descriptions.search_knowledge_base_params` for parameters

### Files Modified
- `backend/app/services/mcp_service.py` - Parameter description support in tool handlers
- `backend/app/routers/mcp.py` - New endpoint and enhanced config response
- `frontend/src/components/MCPServerManager.tsx` - Full editing UI implementation
- `frontend/src/components/KnowledgeBaseDetail.tsx` - Full editing UI implementation

## Recent Exploration: External URL Access Testing (January 2026)

### What Was Tested
Verified curl command-line tool functionality for accessing external documentation:
- **Test URL**: https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/data/documentation/AVRouting.json
- **Result**: Successfully retrieved JSON documentation data
- **Content**: Apple's AVRouting framework documentation with full metadata

### Potential Future Applications
This testing validates the system's capability for:
1. **URL-Based Ingestion**: Add documents directly from web URLs
2. **Documentation Scraping**: Pull API docs from developer sites
3. **External API Integration**: Fetch data from external sources for knowledge bases
4. **Web Content Processing**: Process HTML/JSON content for indexing

### Technical Observations
- System has curl available and functional
- Can access HTTPS URLs without issues
- JSON parsing would enable structured data ingestion
- Could complement existing file upload functionality

## Project Completion Status: 100% ✅
